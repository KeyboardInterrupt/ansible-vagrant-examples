# Example01 - It Works!

This is a very basic example of the Ansible provisioner.

All it does is, spin up a virtual machine, and provision the example Playbook `playbook.yml` onto it

## Usage

If you run `vagrant up`, Vagrant will spin up a virtual machine running Ubuntu16.04 and provsion the Ansible playbook `playbook.yml` onto it.
